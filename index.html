		<h2>Google Doodle</h2>
		<p>This is an interactive Google doodle that started with the theme "tea." I pushed forward to explore the feelings associated with tea. Tea is calming and serene, and is associated with a sense of peace and tranquility. I created a scene that conveys those feelings.</p>
		<p>The string on the right can be pulled (clicked) to toggle the lights, the cat's tail is animated using a sprite sheet, and the teapot lid bounces when the mouse passes over it. The window also opens and triggers a leaf to animate through the scene.</p>
		<p>Where is the UX in this? It's everywhere, but especially in the window. I noticed that no one clicked the window when interacting with my design, unless I personally prompted them to. That meant that no one saw the leaf I spent so much time and energy animating.
			The fix I implemented was to automatically open the window 3 seconds after the page loads, if the user hasn't already done so. What I observed after implementing this fix was users began clicking the window to see if they could close it again, or if the leaf would
			re-animate when they opened it again. By automatically opening the window, I showed the user that they could do so as well.</p>

		<h2>New Yorker Cover</h2>
		<p>The prompt for this work was to create a cover for the New Yorker magazine that challenged the Millenial stereotype.</p>
		<p>I was born in 1997, which means I am <i>technically</i> Gen Z, but I often get lumped into the Millenial generation because no one realizes that not all of Gen Z is twelve. For this reason, I still relate to the plight of the Millenial.</p>
		<p>When my father graduated high school, college wasn't a necessity yet. Decent jobs were still available if you had the right work ethic and attitude. Now, there are people with degrees working at McDonald's because they can't find a job in their field.
			Competition is heavy out there. Even with a degree, there are no guarantees. Yet, many from the older generations expect the younger generations to succeed the same way they did: with brute force and a can-do attitude.</p>
		<p>My cover shows that Millenials are working hard, but it's harder to reach the conventional milestones of success than it used to be. I've illustrated the experience of college graduation by comparing it to an arcade; you spend time and money to play the game and
			do everything you're supposed to, but in the end, you still might not have everything you need. The prizes on the wall are ranked according to what most people see as "success", "mediocrity" and "failure".</p>
		<p>The two characters also show how diversity has changed throughout the generations. The Millenial and Gen Z generations are the most diverse generations in American history. They also demonstrate the class structure in America. The arcade owner has abundant
			wealth, yet his prices are high and his arcade's payout is low. Without help, there is no way this student can afford the "successful" prizes.</p>
		<p>And this wouldn't truly be a piece about Millenials if there wasn't a nod to avocado toast in there.</p>

		<h2>Circus Poster</h2>
		<p>This was an exploration of type and type layout in a poster format. My goal was to capture the aesthetic of classic circus posters with a modern design touch.</p>
		<p>The "CHINESE" heading is custom and was created in Illustrator specifically for this project.
			And don't worry, I took great care with the type in "VARIETY SHOW" as I was adjusting the heights of the letters to ensure that strokes and counters weren't destroyed.</p>

		<h2>Summer of '81 Typeface</h2>
		<p>This typeface was created as an expansion on a project which required hand-lettering. I liked the lettering I had done so much that I wanted to use it for other projects, but didn't want to have to painstakingly recreate it every time.
			For that reason, I decided to make it into a bona-fide typeface.</p>
		<p>This is an album cover I designed to display my typeface in use. This piece demonstrates the aesthetic and style of the typeface itself, and shows a real-life scenario where one might use it.
			It also shows how the two styles (black and outline) could be used together for design purposes.

		<h2>EWU 2018 Voter Drive</h2>
		<p>Following the 2016 election, politics have been a mess. EWU wanted to encourage students to vote in the 2018 midterm elections and host a voter drive to help them do so.</p>
		<p>Before I could start designing, I had to figure out who the audience was and what issues they were facing. According to
			<a href="https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/eastern-washington-university/student-life/diversity/chart-age-diversity.html" target="_blank">College Factual</a>,
		approximately 83% of EWU students are between the ages of 18 - 29. As a person of that age group, a common theme I heard from my peers was that they didn't believe their vote mattered.
		Especially after the 2016 election, voter disenfranchisement has become a hot topic in politics. I chose to center my campaign design around that idea of helplessness and apathy.</p>
		<p>The megaphone became a common theme in my designs due to its symbolism. A megaphone amplifies whatever is said into it, which I felt was an appropriate metaphor for the voting process and congress.</p>

		<h2>Alice in Wonderland Book Cover</h2>
		<p>This is a book jacket designed with a limited color palette and a minimalistic style. I wanted to edge away from the cluttered "psychadelic" themes in the book and create something clean and inviting.</p>
		<p>I've never actually read <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, and I've only seen the movie a couple of times a long time ago. I had to do a lot of research into the book in order to get this jacket right, and I chose to mesh
		imagery and themes from the movie with those in the book. By doing so, I created a design that appeals to both people who have read the book before and those who have only seen the movie.</p>

		<h2>Benson's Ethical Eats Product Packaging</h2>
		<p>Benson's Ethical Eats is a fictional brand I created as an extension of a fictional company, Benson's Ethical Eatery. The idea behind the brand is that products like honey and jam would be sold at Benson's Ethical Eatery cafes,
			similar to how Starbucks sells their own brand in their coffee shops.</p>
		<p>Benson's Ethical Eats is a vegan company focused on the ethical sourcing of food rather than abstaining from animal products altogether. They believe that non-vegans would be more convinced to convert to veganism and support ethical farming practices if
			it didn't mean they had to stop eating meat and dairy completely. As such, the company and their products are all natural, as if you made them yourself at home.</p>
		<p>The typeface used as headings on the labels is a personal typeface, which is still in development, called Organic Sans. The overall feel of the design system is homey and organic. Nothing is too rigid or clean. The products look friendly and approachable.</p>
		<p>Where's the UX? It's in a little bit of everything, but mostly in the design of the honey jar. Honey is an extremely sticky food and is difficult to clean from silverware/utensils. As a fix, the honey jar has a honey dipper attached to the underside of the lid
			so that it is always there and reusable whenever you need it. No need to wash it again and again, as it stays in the jar.</p>
		<p>What if you don't use your honey for a while and the honey hardens and crystalizes? Won't the dipper be stuck and prevent you from opening the jar? Don't worry; the lid is not a screw-top, which means you only need to pull on the lid to remove it.
			Also, the label includes instructions on what to do if you can't remove the lid due to crystalized honey, even by pulling.</p>

		<h2>Spark Central Collateral</h2>
		<p>Spark Central of Spokane was in need of cohesive graphic collateral to unify their online brand identity. They already had a brand identity and design guidelines, but their website graphics for events didn't reflect them.</p>
		<p>They specifically needed graphics for partnership programs/events and benefits. They also wanted flyers, posters, and social media collateral. By doing research into the three partners specified by Spark Centreal and using their own
			design guidelines for my work, I created this set of designs.

	<h2>About the Designer</h2>

	<p>Hello! I'm Emily: a girl with an eclectic collection of interests.</p>

	<p>For my first two years of college, I was a computer science major who thought she wanted to be a game developer. I was minoring in 3D animation and game design. It wasn't until junior year that I took a design course and changed my major three weeks
		into the quarter. Now, I look back and wonder how I ever didn't know I was a designer.</p>

	<p>So here I am, a designer with a bit of programmer in her. I also still have some of that love for games, but I've realized that the part of game development I actually wanted to do all along was the animation and design. That being said, my favorite
		projects are interactive SVG animations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
	
	<p>I also enjoy illustration now that I've found my style and gotten comfortable with Procreate. You can see more examples of my illustration work on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/weird.by.design/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>

	<p>Oh, and as for my "eclectic collection of interests," I'm a fan of retro fashion, I collect teapots, and if you ask me about my cats, I'll talk about them forever.</p>
